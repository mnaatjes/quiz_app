"We know very little about the life of the mathematician Diophantus (called the father of algebra) except that he lived around the year 250 B.C. Due to one admirer of his, who described his life by the means of an algebraic riddle, we can at least determine his age at death: Diophantuss youth lasted 1/6 of his life. He had his first beard in the next 1/12 of his life. At the end of the following 1/7 of his life Diophantus got married. Five years from then his son was born.

Before you can cross their bridge, you have to give them half of the cakes you are carrying, but as they are kind trolls, they each give you back a single cake. What is the minimum number of cakes you will have to leave home with to make sure that you arrive at Grandmas with exactly 2 cakes?",BRAIN_TEASERS_86ae_0204,2,BRAIN_TEASERS_OPT_e448_000C
